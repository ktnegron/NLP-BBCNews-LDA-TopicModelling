# NLP_BBCNews_LDA_TopicModelling

This Jupyter notebook serves as a practical guide for those interested in exploring NLP techniques to extract valuable insights from textual data.

I have used Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique called topic modelling and LDA to extract the most relevant words from BBC news feed data. The data includes daily news entries which were scraped using libraries such as Beautiful Soup. I have used other libraries like gensim, nltk for corpus creation, tokenization, vectorization, and data extraction. The notebook also includes the creation of a word cloud and a word network graph to visually represent the extracted data.
